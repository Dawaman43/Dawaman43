### About This Shinobi

Born under the Ethiopian highlands, trained in the hidden dojos of Addis Ababa University & Evangadi Tech.  
I turn coffee into code, bugs into features, and 3 AM panic into working demos.

When I’m not shipping Rasengans (commits), you’ll find me:
- Eating ramen (obviously)
- Rewriting my portfolio for the 9th time
- Dreaming in TypeScript
